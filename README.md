This one week summer school introduced participants to mathematical techniques at the intersection of machine learning, inverse problems, and statistical inference, with an emphasis on numerical aspects. Mornings included lectures that provide a foundational understanding of the field. Participants learned about state-of-the-art approaches for solving both deterministic and statistical inverse problems of varying complexity. In the afternoons, participants engaged in hands-on assignments to gain practical experience. They learned how to execute code on a modern high-performance computing architecture.

The summer school also featured research talks by leading scientist in the field. Participants had also the oportunity to present their research results during a poster session.

A tentative schedule for the summer school is included below. 

Code snippets for the problems discussed in this class will be posted on GitHub: https://github.com/andreasmang/chameleon.

### Lectures

The summer school included eight lectures. These lectures covered the following material: 

* Introduction to Inverse Problems
* Spectral Operator Theory in Inverse Problems
* Convex Optimization
* Convex Non-Smooth Optimization
* Optimization in Machine Learning
* Inverse Problems Governed by Dynamical Systems
* Numerical Methods for Machine Learning 

### Participants

40 participants attended the workshop. They discussed the presented material, worked on project assignments related to the material covered during the lectures, and participated in a poster presentation. The participants are listed on the following webpage.
